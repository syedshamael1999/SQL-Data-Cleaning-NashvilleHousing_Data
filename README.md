# 🧹 SQL Data Cleaning NashvilleHousing Data


This project focuses on cleaning the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL. The dataset has 56,478 rows and 19 columns.  
The following cleaning steps were performed:


1. 🗓️ Standardized Date Format 
   - Used `CAST()` to convert `SaleDate` from `DateTime` to `Date` format.

2. 🔄 Populated Null Values 
   - Used `JOIN` to fill missing `PropertyAddress` values using `ParcelID` as a reference.

3. 🏡 Split Property Address 
   - Used `CHARINDEX()`, `LEFT()`, and `RIGHT()` to extract `Address` and `City` into separate columns from `PropertyAddress`.

4. 🏠 Split Owner Address 
   - Used `PARSENAME()` and `REPLACE()` to extract `Address`, `City`, and `State` into separate columns from `OwnerAddress`.

5. ✅ Standardized SoldAsVacant Field 
   - Used `CASE WHEN` to convert 'Y' and 'N' values to 'Yes' and 'No'.

6. 🗑️ Removed Duplicates 
   - Used `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)` to identify and delete duplicate rows.

7. ⚙️ Dropped Unused Columns 
   - Used `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` to remove `PropertyAddress`, `OwnerAddress`, and `SaleDate`.

8. ✍️ Renamed Columns 
   - Used `sp_rename` to rename newly created columns for clarity.

This cleaned dataset is now ready for further analysis and visualization.
